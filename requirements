How to Run Your Herbal-Tox Website

Open your "HerbalTox" folder.

Open a Command Terminal:

On Windows: Right-click inside the folder (in a blank space) and select "Open in Terminal" or type 'cmd' in the address bar.

On Mac: Open Terminal and type 'cd ' then drag your folder into the window.

Install the Brains (Libraries):
Copy and paste this command into the terminal and hit Enter:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Wait for it to finish downloading everything).

Launch the Website:
Copy and paste this command and hit Enter:

streamlit run app.py

Success!
Your browser should automatically open a new tab with your website running.
If it doesn't, the terminal will show a URL (like http://localhost:8501). Copy that into your browser.

Troubleshooting

If it says "pip is not recognized", you didn't check "Add Python to PATH" when installing Python. Reinstall Python and check that box.

If it says "ModuleNotFoundError", run step 3 again.
